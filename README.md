# Iterative Parallel Test to Detect and Diagnose ofMultiple Defects for Digital Microfluidic Biochip

### Abstract
Digital microfluidic biochip is a revolutionizing plat-form  to  execute  complex  bioassay  operations  concurrently.  De-pendability is an important feature of digital microfluidic biochipwhich   is   used   for   many   safety-critical   applications,   such   aspoint-of-care health assessment, air-quality monitoring, and food-safety testing. Therefore to ensure the proper functionality of thebiochip  a  robust  offline  and  online  testing  is  required.  Testingcan  be  done  before  manufacturing  or  concurrently  with  otherbioassay operations. In this work, we are presenting an efficientparallel  testing  and  diagnosis  scheme  to  reveal  the  location  ofall  the  faulty  electrodes.  Most  of  the  algorithms  present  in  theliterature  are  mainly  focused  on  single  fault  identification.  Butthe  diagnosis  of  biochip  with  multiple  faults  is  not  addressedproperly. Even some of the algorithms have incorrectly classifiedthe  non  faulty  electrode  as  a  faulty  electrode.  Thus  in  thispaper, we are mainly focusing on the detection of multiple faults,correctly and efficiently. Moreover, this testing method is capableto  check  the  given  biochip  with  other  concurrently  runningbioassay operations.
